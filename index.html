                     Hello! Im Yensey Murillo, a web developer in the making. I have always been a person who loves
                     to be creative. Some of my favorite hobbies are photography, painting, crafting, and traveling. 
                     I was the Director of Photography at my university's student newspaper, The Bridge.

                <p>
                    I majored in psychology with a minor in biology at Texas A&M International University. I know what you're thinking... 
                    "How is that related to art or computers?!" Well it's not, but a couple of months from finishing my degree, I decided to 
                    do a major career change and follow my dreams. How cheesy! But I have never felt more happier in my life!
                </p>
                <p>
                    With that being said... Welcome to my journey!
